```bash
python script.py
./script.py
./path/script.py

xonsh script.xsh
./script.xsh
./path/script.xsh

./script   # shebang should has "env python" or "env xonsh"
script     # script should be found in $PATH and shebang should has "env python" or "env xonsh"
```

xpip install xontrib-argcomplete
xontrib load argcomplete
